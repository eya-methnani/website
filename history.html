		<h3>WHO ARE WE ? </h3>
		<p>Positive and Sociable Citizens is a club founded in 2011 within the national school of computer science ENSI,
			supported by the regional committee of the Tunisian Red Crescent in La Manouba, it is in cooperation with
			worthy associations and organizations trust of civil society.
			In its beginnings, it had a purely awareness-raising and ambulatory health purpose. Now, our club is no
			longer limited to these two axes, a humanitarian and voluntary axis is added to all its activities.
			Every year, Citoyens Positifs et Sociables organizes first aid training, blood donation days, visits to
			child protection centers, visits to centers for the protection of the elderly, and finally visits to primary
			schools in the rural areas. The club's visits to schools are very well studied and are based on several
			criteria: standard of living of the areas to be visited, climatic conditions, financial conditions.</p>
